# RegistryV2

This is a version 2 of a registry for registering URLs with metadata. It has been developed with Meteor and Vue. 
Currently it has four subregistries: mathcoach, sagecell, notebooks and scripts.

The differs from the previous version from the deleted github repo ingodahn/Registry:
* New subregistry for jupyter notebooks and related files
* Only german user interface
* Only admin can create new users

***Note:*** Due to incompatibilities of the Mongodb installation process of Meteor >2.5 with Ubuntu 20.04 this may not work with actual versions of Meteor.
